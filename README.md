This is a GUI based application called Virtual Global College. This application is entirely created by using Jframes in java. For the purpose of storing the data, database was created. For the connection of the database Xxamp was used because we were having problems with mysql workbench. So, we decided to use Xxamp as it was easier alternative option.
This application is built in a way that we have different forms but no matter which form you run you will have to go through login page. Which means that only registered logins will be able to access. Application will open the forms according to the login details entered. Once the admin is logged in, he can create new users and allow them access. Everyone will only see their respective details, for instance students will only see their student details in order to access other features you will have to logout and login again with the respective id.
To run the application connection to the database is required will be provided in the final submit. There are some jar files used to connect the database and for the calendar in one of the forms. Those jar files are needed to be mapped according to the user computer in order to work properly.

For testing, required logins are given below:

Admin:
Username: Luke		Password: 12345678
Student:
Username: Bolt		Password: 12345678
Faculty:
Username: Jackey		Password: 12345678
